**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_shaheenkaipally/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The project involves developing an MVP that leverages various technologies to meet the business needs of the LCA team. Linux command lines and Bash scripts will enable efficient command execution and automation of tasks. PostgreSQL will be used as the database management system for storing and retrieving data. Docker will facilitate easy deployment and management of the application in a containerized environment. IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) will provide a user-friendly coding environment for efficient development and debugging. Collectively, these technologies will enable us to create a robust and scalable solution for the LCA team's data analysis and decision-making needs. 


## Highlighted Projects
**Portfolio Website** [[GitHub](https://github.com/shaheenkaipally/webportfolio)]: Developed a professional portfolio website using NodeJS and ExpressJS as the backend framework, combined with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. By utilizing NodeJS and ExpressJS, I was able to create dynamic and interactive web pages. The HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap allowed me to design a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices. To ensure seamless collaboration and version control, I pushed the website code to GitHub. Moreover, the website is hosted on Heroku, providing easy accessibility for visitors to explore and learn more about my work.

**Clothing Brand E-Commerce Website** [[GitHub](https://dev-gothboithrift.pantheonsite.io/)]: I have successfully developed an e-commerce website using WordPress as the content management system and WooCommerce as the e-commerce platform. By leveraging the power of Elementor, I created visually appealing and customizable web pages that perfectly suit the small-scale business's brand and products. WPForms facilitated the creation of user-friendly contact forms for seamless communication with customers. To provide a seamless customer experience, I integrated payment gateways, allowing customers to make secure online transactions. Additionally, I implemented shipping services, ensuring smooth order fulfillment and timely delivery. The website offers a user-friendly interface, secure payment options, and reliable shipping services, all aimed at enhancing the overall shopping experience for customers.
