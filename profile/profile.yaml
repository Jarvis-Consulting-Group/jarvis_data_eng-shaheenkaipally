# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Ever since I got my hands on a computer, I always wondered what goes on behind the screen to make all the software run. Growing up with the passion for technology so computer programming, I developed my skills by learning and practicing several programming languages. I worked on several projects throughout my bachelors in Computer Engineering using Python, Java, C++ and other languages. I graduated from Centennial College with a diploma in computer science majoring in game programming. I perfected my skills by building websites and applications using different stacks.
